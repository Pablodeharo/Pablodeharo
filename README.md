Hey there, I'm Pablo de Haro! 👋
I’ve spent years working in real estate and the automotive sector, but my love for technology and innovation pushed me to start a new adventure in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.
Now, I’m all about turning data into insights—helping businesses make smarter decisions by analyzing and understanding the stories hidden in their data.

I mix my business experience with my technical skills in data science to solve real-world problems. I’m also a huge fan of staying on top of the latest tools and tech in the data world—there’s always something new to learn!
In short, I’m here to tackle the challenges of the digital age with creative, data-driven solutions.
